Program Objective:
Understanding and using of commands like ifconfig, netstat, ping, arp, telnet, ftp, finger,
traceroute, whois
Program Description:
UNIX utilities are commands that, generally, perform a single task. It may be as simple as printing
the date and time, or a complex as finding files that match many criteria throughout a directory
hierarchy
IFCONFIG
The Unix command ifconfig (short for interface configurator) serves to configure and control
TCP/IP network interfaces from a command line interface (CLI).
Common uses for ifconfig include setting an interface's IP address and netmask, and disabling or
enabling a given interface.
Ipconfig is an MS-DOS utility that can be used from MS-DOS and an MS-DOS shell to display
the network settings currently assigned and given by a network. This command can be utilized to
verify a network connection as well as to verify your network settings.
Syntax: ipconfig [/allcompartments] [/? | /all | /renew [adapter] | /release [adapter] | /renew6
[adapter] | /release6 [adapter] | /flushdns | /displaydns | /registerdns | /showclassid adapter |
/setclassid adapter [classid] | /showclassid6 adapter | /setclassid6 adapter [classid] ]
Example: ipconfig /all
Output:

NETSTAT
netstat (network statistics) is a command-line tool that displays network connections (both
incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and a number of network interface statistics.
It is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network
as a performance measurement.
Parameters
Parameters used with this command must be prefixed with a hyphen (-) rather than a slash (/).
-a : Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is
listening.
-e : Displays ethernet statistics, such as the number of bytes and packets sent and received. This
parameter can be combined with -s.
-f : Displays fully qualified domain names <FQDN> for foreign addresses.
-i : Displays network interfaces and their statistics (not available under Windows)
-n : Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed
numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.
-o : Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for each connection.
-p Linux: Process : Show which processes are using which sockets
Syntax: NETSTAT [-a] [-b] [-e] [-f] [-n] [-o] [-p proto] [-r] [-s] [-x] [-t] [interval]
Output:

PING
Ping is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP
network; it is also used to self test the network interface card of the computer, or as a speed test. It
works by sending ICMP “echo request” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo
response” replies. Ping does not estimate the round-trip time, as it does not factor in the user's
connection speed, but instead is used to record any packet loss, and print a statistical summary
when finished.
The word ping is also frequently used as a verb or noun, where it is usually incorrectly used to
refer to the round-trip time, or measuring the round-trip time.
Syntax: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS] [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] |
[-k host-list]] [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-4] [-6 target_name]
Output:

ARP
In computer networking, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is the method for finding a
host's link layer (hardware) address when only its Internet Layer (IP) or some other Network Layer
address is known.
ARP has been implemented in many types of networks; it is not an IP-only or Ethernet-only
protocol. It can be used to resolve many different network layer protocol addresses to interface
hardware addresses, although, due to the overwhelming prevalence of IPv4 and Ethernet, ARP is
primarily used to translate IP addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses.
Arp syntax:

ARP -s inet_addr eth_adr [if_addr]
ARP -d inet_addr [if_addr]
ARP -a [inet_addr] [-N if_addr]
Example: arp -a
Output:

TELNET
Telnet (Telecommunication network) is a network protocol used on the Internet or local area
network (LAN) connections.
Typically, telnet provides access to a command-line interface on a remote machine.
The term telnet also refers to software which implements the client part of the protocol. Telnet
clients are available for virtually all platforms
Protocol details:
Telnet is a client-server protocol, based on a reliable connection-oriented transport. Typically this
protocol is used to establish a connection to TCP port 23
Syntax: telnet [-468ELadr] [-S tos] [-b address] [-e escapechar] [-l user] [-n tracefile] [host [port]]
Example: telnet myhost.com

FTP
File Transfer Protocol (FTP):
FTP is a network protocol used to transfer data from one computer to another through a network
such as the Internet.FTP is a file transfer protocol for exchanging and manipulating files over a
TCP computer network. An FTP client may connect to an FTP server to manipulate files on that
server.FTP runs over TCP. It defaults to listen on port 21 for incoming connections from FTP
clients. A connection to this port from the FTP Client forms the control stream on which commands
are passed from the FTP client to the FTP server and on occasion from the FTP server to the FTP
client. FTP uses out-of-band control, which means it uses a separate connection for control and
data. Thus, for the actual file transfer to take place, a different connection is required which is
called the data stream.
Syntax: ftp [-46pinegvd] [host [port]]
Example: ftp exampleftp.computerhope.com

FINGER:
In computer networking, the Name/Finger protocol and the Finger user information protocol
are simple network protocols for the exchange of human-oriented status and user information.
finger looks up and displays information about system users.
Syntax: finger [-lmsp] [user ...] [user@host ...]
Example: finger -p ch

TRACEROUTE:
traceroute is a computer network tool used to determine the route taken by packets across an IP
network . An IPv6 variant, traceroute6, is also widely available.Traceroute is often used for
network troubleshooting. By showing a list of routers traversed, it allows the user to identify the
path taken to reach a particular destination on the network. This can help identify routing problems
or firewalls that may be blocking access to a site. Traceroute is also used by penetration testers to
gather information about network infrastructure and IP ranges around a given host. It can also be
used when downloading data, and if there are multiple mirrors available for the same piece of data,
one can trace each mirror to get a good idea of which mirror would be the fastest to use.
Syntax: traceroute [-46dFITUnreAV] [-f first_ttl] [-g gate,...] [-i device]
[-m max_ttl] [-p port] [-s src_addr] [-q nqueries]
[-N squeries] [-t tos] [-l flow_label] [-w waittime]
[-z sendwait] [-UL] [-D] [-P proto] [--sport=port] [-M method]

[-O mod_options] [--mtu] [--back] host [packet_len]
Example: traceroute www.google.com

WHO IS:
WHOIS (pronounced "who is"; not an acronym) is a query/response protocol which is widely
used for querying an official database in order to determine the owner of a domain name, an IP
address, or an autonomous system number on the Internet. WHOIS lookups were traditionally
made using a command line interface, but a number of simplified web-based tools now exist for
looking up domain ownership details from different databases. WHOIS normally runs on TCP port
43.
The WHOIS system originated as a method that system administrators could use to look up
information to contact other IP address or domain name administrators (almost like a "white
pages").
Syntax: whois [ -h HOST ] [ -p PORT ] [ -aCFHlLMmrRSVx ] [ -g SOURCE:FIRST-LAST ] [ -i
ATTR ] [ -S SOURCE ] [ -T TYPE ] object
Example: whois www.google.com
socket
To do network I/O, the first thing a process must do is to call the socket system call, specifying
the type of communication protocol desired.

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int socket(int family, int type, int protocol);
The family is one of
AF_UNIX -- Unix internal protocols
AF_INET -- Internet protocols
AF_NS -- Xerox NS Protocols
AF_IMPLINK-- IMP link layer
The AF_ prefix stands for "address family." In the first project, we are going to use AF_INET.
